While developing a better SNSPD model, I found myself referencing the source and redrawing the circuit and dependency chain multiple times. Also plotting internal variables when you are simulating simple circuits and understanding dependencies is easier if you have an interactive version of the circuit. I decided to make a [SNSPD dynamic model circuit](https://github.com/tareqdandachi/snspd-spice/blob/master/doc/snspd_model_deconstructed.asc) that is more visual than the current version of the SNSPD model and will reference it in upcoming posts on a "better" SNSPD model. Hopefully it also is a good introduction to the SNSPD model to people who are unfamiliar with it.
